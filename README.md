# Fullcalendar::Rails

This gem is a simple rebundling of the contents of the JQuery FullCalendar plugin from Adam Shaw:

http://arshaw.com/fullcalendar/

I had created an earlier version of a demonstration of using FullCalendar in a rails app.  That code is available at:

https://github.com/bokmann/rails3_fullcalendar

But I have always disliked finding random files and copying them into a public directory.  So I made an asset gem for use with the asset pipeline.


## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'fullcalendar-rails'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install fullcalendar-rails

At this point, the files from the fullcalendar project are in your asset pipeline's path... all you have to do is require them in the appropriate places.  For instance, in your application.css.scss:

    *= require fullcalendar
    *= require fullcalendar.print

And in your application.js:

    //= require fullcalendar

While its not needed for this library, the original javascript library's author also includes an adapter for integrating google calendars as an event source:

    //= require gcal

## Usage

See the website of the original project for the usage, or my original Rails3 example I point to above.  This gem just saves you from having to locate and copy the javascript and stylesheet into place.

## Motivations

I hate finding random versions of javscript and css out on the web and then just downloading, or copy/pasting into files in my asset pipeline... I like some kind of accountability as to the source of the files, and I especially like it when bundle can tell me when those versioned assets are out of date.  Therefore, I tend to take the few extra minutes to package these things up as versioned gems.

As such, these are primarily for my own use, and may occasionally fall out of date as the project I created them for goes in and out of maintenance cycles.  If thats the case, I will gladly accept pullup requests, or even be willing to talk to someone who wants to take over ownership for the repo and the gem on rubygems.  As with all open source, I hope you find this useful, but if you don't, your right to complain starts with a pullup request.

## Versioning

I am going to version this gem with the version of the fullcalendar code I use, adding an extra digit if I need to release any maintenance versions of the gem itself.

## Contributing

1. Fork it
2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b my-new-feature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Added some feature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin my-new-feature`)
5. Create new Pull Request

If the original library I'm basing this off of has tests, I'd like to integrate that into the gem as well; but if it doesn't, its not the end of the world... as this is just a 'shrinkwrap' of someone else's work, I don't take on any testing responsibility within the scope of packaging.
