# Fullcalendar::Rails

This gem is a simple rebundling of the contents of the JQuery FullCalendar plugin from Adam Shaw:

http://arshaw.com/fullcalendar/

I had created an earlier version of a demonstration of using FullCalendar in a rails app.  That code is available at:

https://github.com/bokmann/rails3_fullcalendar

But I have always disliked finding random files and copying them into a public directory.  So I made an asset gem for use with the asset pipeline.


## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'fullcalendar-rails'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install fullcalendar-rails

## Usage

See the website of the original project for the usage, or my original Rails3 example I point to above.  This gem just saves you from having to locate and copy the javascript and stylesheet into place.

## Versioning

I am going to version this gem with the version of the fullceldnar code I use, adding an extra digit if I need to release any maintenance versions of the gem itself.  Therefore, since this is a first version of this gem and I'm starting by bundling version 1.5.3 of the fullcalendar code, this is version 1.6.0.0
