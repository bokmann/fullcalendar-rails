# FullCalendar for Rails

FullCalendar packaged for the Rails 3.1+ asset pipeline.
Check [FullCalendar project home page](http://arshaw.com/fullcalendar/) and [GitHub page](https://github.com/arshaw/fullcalendar).

This gem is forked from https://github.com/bokmann/fullcalendar-rails which does not include gcal.js and has not been updated to the latest version.
You can read more about the reasons behind this fork [here](https://github.com/bokmann/fullcalendar-rails/commit/0b1b3506ce81cab733fb840749852eafc626e593#commitcomment-1416352) and check the [pull request to the original fullcalendar-rails repository](https://github.com/bokmann/fullcalendar-rails/pull/3).
